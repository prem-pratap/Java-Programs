Language basics questions

1.Write a Program that accepts two Strings as command line arguments and generate the output in the required format. 

Example1)
If the two command line arguments are Wipro and Bangalore then the output generated should be Wipro Technologies Bangalore.

Example2)
If the command line arguments are ABC and Mumbai then the output generated should be ABC Technologies Mumbai 

[Note: It is mandatory to pass two arguments in command line]


2.Write a Program to accept a String as a command line argument and print a Welcome message as given below.

Example1)
C:\> java Sample John
O/P Expected : Welcome John


3.Write a Program to accept two integers as command line arguments and print the sum of the two numbers

Example1)
C:\>java Sample 10 20
O/P Expected : The sum of 10 and 20 is 30


FLOW CONTROL STATEMENTS
1. Write a program to check if a given integer number is Positive, Negative, or Zero.

2. Write a program to check if a given integer number is odd or even.

3. Write a program to check if the program has received command line arguments or not.

If the program has not received arguments then print "No Values", else print all the values in a single line separated by ,(comma)

Example1) java Example
O/P: No values

Example2) java Example Mumbai Bangalore
O/P: Mumbai,Bangalore

[Hint: You can use length property of an array to check its length]


4.Initialize two character variables in a program and display the characters in alphabetical order.

Example1) if the first character is 's' and second character is 'e' then the output should be  e,s

Example2) if the first character is 'a' and second character is 'e', then the output should be a,e	


5	.Initialize a character variable in a program and 

print 'Alphabhet' if the initialized value is an alphabhet, 

print 'Digit' if the initialized value is a number, and 

print 'Special Character', if the initialized value is anything else.
	


6	.Write a program to accept gender ("Male" or "Female") and age from command line arguments and print the percentage of interest based on the given conditions.

If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.2%.

If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 9.2%.

If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.4%.

If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 10.5%.


7.Initialize a character variable with an alphabhet in a program.

If the character value is in lowercase, the output should be displayed in uppercase in the following format.

Example1)
i/p:a
o/p:a->A

If the character value is in uppercase, the output should be displayed in lowercase in the following format.

Example2)
i/p:A
o/p:A->a	


8	.Write a program to receive a color code from the user (an Alphabhet). 

The program should then print the color name, based on the color code given. 

The following are the color codes and their corresponding color names.
R->Red, B->Blue, G->Green, O->Orange, Y->Yellow, W->White. 

If color code provided by the user is not valid then print "Invalid Code". 

Write a program to receive a number and print the corresponding month name.

Example1)

C:\>java Sample 12

O/P Expected : December

Example2)

C:\>java Sample 

O/P Expected : Please enter the month in numbers

Example3)

C:\>java Sample 15

O/P Expected : Invalid month


10.(Switch Statement	)Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 in a single row with one tab space.


11.(For Loop	)Write a program to print even numbers between 23 and 57. Each number should be printed in a separate row.


12.(For Loop	)Write a program to check if a given number is prime or not.


13.(For Loop	)Write a program to print prime numbers between 10 and 99.


14.Write a Java program to find if the given number is prime or not.

Example1)
C:\>java Sample 
O/P: Please enter an integer number 

Example2)
C:\>java Sample 1
O/P:1 is neither prime nor composite

Example3)
C:\>java Sample 0
O/P: 0 is neither prime nor composite
 
Example4)
C:\>java Sample 10
O/P: 10 is not a prime number

Example5)
C:\>java Sample 7
O/P : 7 is a prime number


15.Write a program to print the sum of all the digits of a given number.

Example1) 
I/P:1234
O/P:10


16.Write a program to print * in Floyds format (using for and while loop)
*
*  *
*  *   *

Example1)
C:\>java Sample 
O/P: Please enter an integer number

Example2)
C:\>java Sample 3
O/P :
*
*  * 
*  *  *


17. Write a program to reverse a given number and print

Example1)
I/P: 1234
O/P:4321

Example2)
I/P:1004
O/P:4001


18. Write a Java program to find if the given number is palindrome or not

Example1)
C:\>java Sample 110011
O/P: 110011 is a palindrome

Example2)
